                <p class=".tab" style="text-indent: 40px;">Dr. Munasure Ab-awyea was a leading scientist in the United Federation of Universal Powers, the most powerful nation in the universe. His discoveries and inventions alone were to mind boggle the average citizen. In fact, many times over, he helped the Federation through the toughest of times. Even though he faced numerous assassination attempts, he always looked for a brighter future and a better universe.</p>
                <p class=".tab" style="text-indent: 40px;">He was a quiet and thoughtful child born in 2771.02.12 at the far outskirts of the Remellian Territories. His parents were distinguished scientists in their fields, but not as distinguished as he was to become.</p>
              <p class=".tab" style="text-indent: 40px;">Dr. Ab-awyea attended the Daystrom Institute and the Science Academy of Earth, two of the most prestigious universities in the country.</p>
